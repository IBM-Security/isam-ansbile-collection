# Default homedir.  This defaults to inventory_dir for backwards compatibility reasons,
#  even though the inventory_dir should NEVER be used to store files (should basically only contain files that can be parsed by an inventory_plugin)
#  a better default value for homedir, would be playbook_dir:
#       homedir: "{{ playbook_dir }}"
#  so this is a varialb
