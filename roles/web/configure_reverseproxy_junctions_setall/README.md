# configure_reverseproxy_junctions_setall

Role to configure junctions, with a single input of ALL junctions in a list.

This does not support deleting junctions.

This is very difficult to debug, so it's recommended, if you run into problems, to use the web.configure_reverseproxy_junctions role instead
, figure out what the problem is, and then try this again.
