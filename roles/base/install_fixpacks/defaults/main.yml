# default variables for installing multiple fix packs

file: "{{ item.file }}"
filename: "{{ item.file | basename }}"

# Default homedir.  This defaults to inventory_dir for backwards compatibility reasons,
#  even though the inventory_dir should NEVER be used to store files (should basically only contain files that can be parsed by an inventory_plugin)
#  a better default value for homedir, would be playbook_dir:
#       `homedir: "{{ playbook_dir }}"`
#  Set to "" , to be able to define a file relative from your project directory
#
homedir: ""
