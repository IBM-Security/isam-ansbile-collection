# Default variables for exporting personal certificates from databases
export_personal_certificates: []
# skip multiple exports
skip_exports: false

# Default homedir.  This defaults to inventory_dir for backwards compatibility reasons,
#  even though the inventory_dir should NEVER be used to store files (should basically only contain files that can be parsed by an inventory_plugin)
#  a better default value for homedir, would be playbook_dir:
#       `homedir: "{{ playbook_dir }}"`
#  so this is a variable
homedir: "{{ inventory_dir }}"
