# Default homedir.  This defaults to inventory_dir for backwards compatibility reasons,
#  even though the inventory_dir should NEVER be used to store files (should basically only contain files that can be parsed by an inventory_plugin)
#  a better default value for homedir, would be root_playbook_dir (see next variable):
#       homedir: "{{ root_playbook_dir }}"
#
homedir: "{{ inventory_dir }}"

# This is the default variable to indicate the root playbook dir (meaning, the project directory)
# We can use this instead of `playbook_dir`, because for playbooks in the collection, that will be a location in the collection.
# You need to overwrite this, to use it effectively !
# For instance `ansible-playbook ... -e root_playbook_dir=${pwd}
root_playbook_dir: "{{ playbook_dir }}"
